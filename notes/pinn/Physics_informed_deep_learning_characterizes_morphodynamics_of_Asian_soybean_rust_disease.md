Please find paper [at this link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26577-1). The [arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07345) is much longer. This paper is an applied paper using PINN to solve a Fokker-Planck equation, a topic under my current interest. It may be highly problem specific, but let's see.

* Diffusion dominated problems are typically easier to learn.
> The uncovered landscapes show that morphodynamics are diffusion-dominated until the germ tube begins to bend, at which point deterministic forces begin to drive trajectories apart.

(08/01/2023) I've skimmed through this paper and it's hard to tell if the PINN is going to solve general problems, if time requires me to come back to PINNs, I will give it more thought.
